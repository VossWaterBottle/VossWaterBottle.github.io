    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      Within this project we made use of SpaCy to help find meangingful words within text. SpaCy allows the user to scan through all the text and find what words are most
      meangingful or repeated the most. Of course you can also filter out any filler words such as "the", "and", etc. In the begining of the project we looked over "Pride and Prejudice"
      I then chose my own literature to analyse and for that I picked "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". I picked this book as its my all time favourite!
