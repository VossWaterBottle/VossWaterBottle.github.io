      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        For this project we refactored our original turtle code in order to be more efficient in creating graphics. We did this by creating functions and for loops for different
        aspects of the graphic. For example, instead of repeating single lines of code to command the turtle to create a graphic, you simply call a previously made function. 
        This allows you to create much more detailed graphics as well as learning how to write efficient code with Python.
